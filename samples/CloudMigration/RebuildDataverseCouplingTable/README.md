# Rebuild Dataverse Couplings extension

Use this extension to rebuild the Dataverse connectors after cloud migration. Integration records are not accessible from the regular code. If you migrated from the version where you used Datavarse integration based on Integration Records, you must release this extension to rebuild the couplings.
