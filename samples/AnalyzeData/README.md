# How can I use Data Analysis?
Data Analysis is meant for quick fact checking and ad-hoc analysis when you don't want to run a report, if a report for your specific needs does exist, or if you want to quickly iterate to get a good overview on part of your business.

In the following table, you'll find examples of usage scenarios for each main area in the Business Central application.

| Area    | Scenario | How Data Analysis can help | Data Foundation | Fields to get you started | Built-in report(s) | 
| ------- | ---------| -------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Finance (Accounts Receivables) | See what your customers owe you, maybe broken down into time intervals for when amounts are due. | Open the Customer Ledger Entries list and switch on Analyze. Go to the Columns menu and remove all columns (click the box next to the _Search_ field). Turn on _Pivot_ mode (located directly above the _Search_ field). Now, drag the _Customer Name_ field to the _Row Groups_ area and drag _Remaining Amount_ to the _Values_ area. Finally, find the _Due Date Month_ field and drag it to the _Column Labels_ area. If you want to restrict the analysis to a given year/quarter, apply a filter in the _Additional Filters_ menu (to the right, just below the _Columns_ menu.) Rename your analysis tab to "Aged Accounts by Month" or something that describes this analysis for you. | [Customer Ledger Entries](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?page=25) | _Customer Name_, _Due Date_, and _Remaining Amount_. | [Aged Accounts Receivables](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?report=120) </br> [Customer Statement](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/?report=1316)  |
